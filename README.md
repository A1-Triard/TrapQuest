# TrapQuest
Partially redacted public version of the source code for the indie adult roguelike game.

Required is inform 6F95. 
Maybe t's possbile to install the binary, but on arch linux it could also be installed from source:
https://github.com/ptomato/gnome-inform7/archive/6F95.tar.gz

the ni file can be downloaded here:

Required to install is gtkhtml version 3.something (not libgtkhtml). This package is orphaned. Also gnome-inform had another issue but with make -k but it seemed a harmless ine, at least make -k and make -k install resulted in a working binary.
