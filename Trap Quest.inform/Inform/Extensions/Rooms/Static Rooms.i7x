The first room defined is the room the player starts in. So we'll create a room called Start that allows us to use 'if the player is in Start' to determine whether the game has been initialised yet.

Start is a room.

[!<loading:Room>*

Legacy room that was used to try and avoid the weird crash when trying to load from the main menu. Seemed to help a little bit so I'm keeping it for now in case I ever put it back in the game.

*!]
Loading is a room. "Type '[bold type]restore[roman type]' to load your save file.".
