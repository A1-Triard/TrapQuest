[!<TheDangerBlocksMasturbationRule>+

Only sluts can masturbate when they're about to get fucked. The rules for masturbating while being fucked are a little different, so we leave the check masturbation function to handle that.

+!]
This is the danger blocks masturbation rule:
	if the player is in danger and the raw sex addiction of the player < 12 and the player is not extremely horny and the number of monsters penetrating a body part is 0:
		if auto is 0, say "You're not [if the raw sex addiction of the player > 9]quite [end if]addicted to sex enough to masturbate in front of an unfriendly enemy!";
		rule fails.
The danger blocks masturbation rule is listed last in the global masturbation restriction rules.
