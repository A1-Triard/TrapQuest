So I thought maybe why not, like, do what I do anyway, but like, get paid for it, right?  So anyway the reason I was thinking about this is because I'd just arrived at this school place, right. You know the school?  Oh right, where we are right now, yeah!  So you know the school. So I was thinking, I've got to become a teacher, right?  So I start talking about stuff and things and whatever and this guy who was like TOTALLY rude just shoved [if diaper quest is 1]a pacifier[otherwise]his [manly-penis][end if] into my mouth and was all like [']That should shut you up['] and I was all like [']Oh hell no['] and so I like sucked on it but also like kept on talking, right?  Because I can do both at the same time. I know, it sounds a bit weird but I can, trust me. So I'm like sucking on this stupid thing and trying to be a teacher at the same time and whatever and then I get told no I'm not a teacher I'm a student, right?  Like, who does that, you know what I mean?  But then they point to my armband, and roll their eyes. So rude, right?  But anyway, I look at my armband and they're totally right; like, totally!
