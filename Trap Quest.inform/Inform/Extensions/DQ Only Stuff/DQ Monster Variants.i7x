	say "[big he of M] is wearing [if the explorer-bimbo of M is 0]a set of clothing which is a fashionable but provocative mixture of blue latex and black leather. It would be somewhat acceptable for this place if it wasn't for the bottom half - her sizeable rump is covered by nothing except a plain white disposable diaper. In one hand [he of M] has a white bag of holding, which again would look fine... If it wasn't for the fact that it has the words 'DIAPER CHANGING KIT' printed on each side[otherwise]a super short frilly pink babydoll dress with matching stockings and mary janes with pretty bows, a far cry away from [his of M] stylish blue and black thigh-highs, shoulder-length gloves and overbust corset that he was wearing before. [big he of M] still has a bag of holding, but it's now even more clearly a diaper bag, with pouches for baby milk and diaper changing equipment, and coloured in baby pink and baby blue. Speaking of baby pink, [his of M] fully exposed disposable diaper is thicker than before, and has a lovely shade of baby pink to parts of it, which perfectly match [his of M] bag, stockings and parts of [his of M] dress[end if][if the explorer-bimbo of M is 2]. The warm, cheerful look on [his of M] face and the way [he of M][']s shamelessly got [his of M] legs spread on the bed suggests to you that [he of M] is completely content[otherwise].[end if]".

When [he of M] pulls [his of M] skirt up to check it, you can see that it is thoroughly soaked - [he of M] is in desperate need of a change, but doesn't seem to want to admit it[otherwise if the explorer-bimbo of M is 1]is now wearing less modest clothes, including a shorter purple skirt that keeps [his of M] superthick white diaper on view at all times. [big his of M] short hair is tied into makeshift pigtails. [big he of M] looks very embarrassed[otherwise]is now wearing even more embarrassing clothes, including a super short pink skirt that barely covers 20% of [his of M] superthick white diaper.
