A wearthing can be predicament-normal, predicament-temporary or predicament-fixed (this is the predicament-persistence property). A wearthing is usually predicament-normal. [AFTER initial predicament execution, anything not predicament-fixed gets set to predicament-temporary. Anything predicament-temporary is removed at the end of a predicament. NB this means that if a wearthing is summoned DURING initial predicament execution, it must be manually set to predicament-fixed.

We also use predicament-fixed to set clothing in the junk room to be immune to change.]

The inventoryFocusPriority of a wearthing is usually 25. [At the end of the clothing list]

Definition: a wearthing is unworn:
	if it is worn, decide no;
	if it is clothing and it is listed in the list of stacked diapers, decide no;
	decide yes.

REQUIRES COMMENTING

@inherits <WearThing>

@!]
A clothing is a kind of wearthing. A clothing is wearable. Understand "worn" as clothing when item described is worn. Understand "unworn", "not worn" as clothing when item described is unworn. Understand "held", "carried", "taken" as a thing when item described is carried. Understand "unheld", "uncarried", "not held", "not carried", "untaken", "not taken" as a thing when item described is not held.

[for the character window labels]
A clothing has a number called previous-labels.
A clothing has a number called total-labels.
A clothing has a number called label-width.

The inventoryFocusPriority of a clothing is usually 10. [This is the order in which they should be displayed in inventory menu slots. I'm leaving gaps in the numbers for more items I haven't thought of yet.]

Clothing can be cotton, latex, glass, leather, pvc, satin, mesh, wool, nylon, metal, biological, hemp, silk, velvet, denim, lycra, plastic, polyester (this is the clothing-material property). Clothing is usually cotton. Understand the clothing-material property as describing a clothing.

Clothing can be dense, sheer-when-wet, sheer, see-through (this is the clothing-transparency property). Understand the clothing-transparency property as describing a clothing. Clothing is usually dense. [Sheer and see-through clothing does not prevent humiliation from being naked but soaks up liquid. Clothing that is see-through can never be less humiliating than being naked. Clothing that is sheer can.]
Definition: a clothing is not-see-through:
	if it is not see-through, decide yes;
	decide no.

[!<Clothing>@<IsActuallySheer>+

Currently see-through.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is actually sheer:
	if C is dense or (C is sheer-when-wet and the total-soak of C is 0), decide no;
	decide yes.

[!<Clothing>@<IsActuallyDense>+

Currently not see-through.

+@!]
Definition: a clothing is actually dense:
	if it is not actually sheer, decide yes;
	decide no.

[Short clothing (usually skirts) expose the crotch when the player is on their knees. Super short clothing never covers the crotch. hobble clothing hinders walking but also makes it crotch covering. NB hobble-skirted clothing also needs to be flagged as crotch-intact.

NEW SYSTEM: skirt-length is an integer.
0: unskirted
1: ultra-short (always exposes everything)
2: super-short (semi-exposes always & BACK exposes while prone)
3: very-short (BACK exposes while prone)
4: short (BACK semi-exposes while prone, FRONT starts to hamper kicks when unslitted)
5: thigh-length (semi-exposes thighs)
6: knee-length (conceals thighs, FRONT starts to hamper knees when unslitted)
7: shin-length (semi-exposes calves, FRONT prevents kicks when unslitted)
8: calf-length (conceals calves, FRONT protects crotch when unslitted)
9: ankle-length (hobble skirt, FRONT prevents knees when unslitted)
10: floor-length (hobble skirt, slows down further)
