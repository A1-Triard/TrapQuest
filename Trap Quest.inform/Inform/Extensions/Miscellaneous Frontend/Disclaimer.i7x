""	"This game is a piece of erotic interactive fiction intended for the consumption by mature adults only.  The following are topics that you can be confident that this game will not contain: gore, scat, extreme torture, sex with real animals.   The game contains offensive gendered slurs and stereotypes, and you may encounter some extremely adult and sometimes taboo topics, including but not limited to mild physical violence, implied lack of consent, blackmail, degradation, and sex with inhuman (fantasy) creatures.   These topics are presented in the context of a FICTIONAL UNIVERSE that does not reflect the author's views or the reality of modern day society.  In the same way that you would not watch the movie Saw and then consider it any more morally acceptable to torture or murder people, you should not, after playing this game, be under any impression that the acts encountered are any less morally despicable than you previously held.

Similarly you should not understand the stereotypes portrayed and played on in this game to be an accurate reflection of people, or trends of people.  In the real world, men, women and others who do not fit into the binary gender spectrum should be respected and treated equally, judged on their deeds and choices and not on the way they were born.  Acts based on sexist or similar philosophies are only acceptable when used for mutual enjoyment between consenting adults.  It is imperative that you do not play this game unless you are mature enough to be fully aware of this separation between fantasy and reality.  The legal age for you to purchase and view adult (R) material in your country may be a reasonable guideline for when you may be approaching this age, but the game author personally recommends not engaging in and consuming such potentially objectionable material as is contained within this game until you are at least 21 years old.

Some images were obtained for this game through image sharing sites where it is a breach of the ToS to upload copyrighted material.  If, however, you do discover images in this game of which you are the copyright holder, please inform the author who will promptly remove them from the game in compliance with the DMCA.  All non-photographic content (the writing, art and the game code) is Aika's intellectual property."	""
