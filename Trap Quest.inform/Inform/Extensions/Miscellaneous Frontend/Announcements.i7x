To compute announcements:

		say "This game's graphical window uses a 'dark mode' which is a lot nicer on the eyes. It's a bit buggy when you use the 'restart' command, so make sure to close the game and then open it again after using 'restart'. IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS GIT, and want your text window background to match the graphics window's background, you need to do the following:[paragraph break]Go into Git > Options, and in the 'Colours' Box, click on the colour under 'Text' and change it to white (or whatever light text colour you prefer). Then click on the 'Background' colour box and in the bottom right of the window that opens, change the Red value to 33, the Green value to 31, and the Blue value to 35. This way your main window will have the same colour scheme as the graphical windows, which are handled by the game itself.[paragraph break]So if you are running this game in Windows Git, please do that now. Got it? ";

The reason for this is that you are being encouraged to customise potential future 'Random Start' runs. What this means is that when an option is set to 'not now' or 'yes this time', it will be randomly set to enabled or disabled each time you choose Random Start. All other settings will remain as you have previously configured them. So if for example you always want TG Fetish enabled but never want watersports fetish enabled and you want everything else to be randomised and surprise you, that is now possible.[line break][bold type]Press any key to continue.[roman type][line break]";

			say "Looking for more ways to reduce the game lag? Once you get used to how the various different objects can be interacted with, I'd strongly recommend switching your 'Button Layout' to Popup Buttons. You can do this from the GUI settings submenu at any point. Doing this lets the images render a bit larger, because there's no space reserved for buttons, and also makes the game go faster as the engine has to think about several less images each turn.[paragraph break]Or, I can make the change for you now. Would you like to try out the Popup Buttons setting? ";

In doing this, the numbers needed to be rearranged, and so now it's likely that your status bar configuration may have changed. For most of you (the people using the fully graphical GUI), it's recommended to be on the MINIMAL configuration. Would you like me to set it that way for you now? ";
